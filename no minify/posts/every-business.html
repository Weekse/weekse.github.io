            <h1>Why Every Business Needs A Website</h1>
            <p>If you’re looking for goods or services what is the mostly common way to find what you need? The answer is to Google it. Searching for a certain type of business or product has never been easier thanks to modern search engines on the internet. It’s fast, easy and almost everyone has the power to do it from a small computer that resides in your pocket. If you don’t have a website you may as well be non-existent to the majority of customers looking for you!</p>
            <p>A website can simply just be a type of digital brochure to show everyone that you exist and what you offer them, or it could be a powerful main tool for your business. No matter the complexity or simplicity it needs to be well designed, clean, practical and professional. It should be consistent with your branding, brochures and business cards - but better! It should tell your potential clients that you have the solution to their problems.</p>
            <p>Every website owner should have something they are proud of, as it will be the main point of conversion from a visitor to a customer or client. The website should be an easy and enjoyable user experience for everyone on every device, if something doesn’t work as expected the user will give up very easily. At some point you would have visited a website that was slow to load, difficult to navigate and find information or just didn’t work well on your mobile phone, and you would have just left the website and looked elsewhere - that website just failed to draw in a new customer. At some point you would have visited a website that was clean and easy to navigate, you didn’t have to think about where you will find what you were looking for, it was intuitive and just worked - a successful website, you probably contacted that business too.</p>
            <p>A website is an investment, but a very worthwhile one. I’ll explain with a hypothetical:</p>
            <p>You just opened your own mechanic workshop and put $750 aside to have a website setup. How many cars do you need to service or repair to break even on that investment? Not very many. Humans are creatures of habit, if they were happy with your services the first time you will probably see them repeatedly - why risk going elsewhere if everything went right? That could be a life long customer for you. They’d start bringing in the cars of their partner and children, they’d mention it to their friends.</p>
            <p>If you want your business to keep up in the modern world, you need a successful website, the main point of focus for your digital presence in this digital world. Regardless of your industry and services or products, the internet is here to stay and the place people go for answers. You greatly benefit from being the answer that they are looking for.</p>
