            <h1>Creating Successful Website Content</h1>
            <p>The content of a website is irrefutably the most important part and so it should be treated that way. Having a good strategy behind your content is paramount to a successful website. Having rich, original content delivered in an engaging way, that’s also easy to digest, while targeting specific keywords to ensure your website gets ranked highly when searched in relevant searches sounds like an enormous task. That’s probably why there’s a whole profession dedicated to it, known as Copywriting (not to be confused with copyright). However successfully accomplishing this task is what separates a successful website from an average website.</p>
            <p><strong>Keywords</strong> strategy is choosing to target specific words that will be used when searching for something that your website will offer. For example if you were offering lawn services you might try and focus on words such as: “lawn”, “care”, “maintenance”, “mowing”, “landscaping”, “garden” as well as your location. These words just thrown in together would sound like a bunch of non-sense so it’s important to create your content in a way that makes sense to read while also being engaging, entertaining and informative.</p>
            <p><strong>Rich in content</strong> means to have <em>as much</em> content as you can. Google ranking favours websites with more text, perceiving them as highly relevant and useful to what was searched. But it’s also very important that this content is <em>original</em> ! If most of the content on a website is just copied from other sources on the internet that website would actually receive a more negative ranking, it becomes less valuable for not being <strong>original</strong>.</p>
            <p>A good method to spice things up while still having rich and original content is to use graphics, images and videos that are relevant to the subject. These can still carry weight when it comes to ranking as media coded into a website contains text to describe the media to visually impaired users. This media text is known in HTML as the “alt tag”, “alt attribute” or “alt description” and having your targeted keywords within the alt tag is a big plus on your ranking score. Having media not only makes things more interesting but “a picture is worth a thousand words” can be applied here, especially if you’re bringing your own personalized media. Using stock images is acceptable however displaying your own high quality media adds a very personal touch which the user will also feel on a personal level, it’s that engagement that creates trust between the user and the website. That trust is what starts a good, long term relationship. </p>
            <p>With a combination of powerful <strong>content</strong> and well structured visual hierarchy, over a beautiful design that fully captures the personality of you or your business results in a <strong>successful website</strong>. Successfully accomplishing this is what will make your website stand out from the crowd.</p>
