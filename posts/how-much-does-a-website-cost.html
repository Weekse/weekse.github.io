            <h1>How Much Does A Website Cost</h1>
            <p>The most common question asked by those seeking web development services, and the most commonly received question by web developers. But it’s too broad a question to answer definitively so the answer really is “it depends”. It’s the same as asking “how long is a piece of string” or “how much does a car cost” - you need to take into account all the variables; what kind of car, how new is the car, what condition etc. The complexity, functionality, design, content, media and everything else determines what is involved in the development of a website. You’ll find quotes ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars and here we’ll briefly outline what these quotes would likely entail.</p>
            <h2><strong>Low Cost</strong></h2><br />
            <p>This usually involves building a website from a template. The functionality and design is pre-coded, all that needs to be done is add your own content in the designated areas. This is a quick and cheap way to have a live website, however the downfall is that you need to tailor your content to fit into the design and layout. Another flaw with templates is that there are hundreds of other websites using the same template thus taking away the unique design and ability to stand out, it also makes it difficult to have your website effectively reflect your brand (if that is your goal).</p>
            <h2><strong>Common and Ideal</strong></h2><br />
            <p>There are multiple phases when developing a customized website tailored to its purpose. First is the planning phase - what content will be available, how it should be displayed, the design and layout fitting the brand behind the website. The second phase is refining the drafted designs into the best possible final design that fully captures the personality and purpose behind the website. Phase three is where the coding and development happen, turning the refined plans of the previous phases into a reality. The fourth phase and usually the last phase is adding the content into the coded website to have a ready-to-go-live website prepared to be presented to the world.</p>
            <p>This is ideal as it gives you a website that is tailored specifically for your purpose and designed to completely capture your brand identity making you seem professional and recognizable - the recipe for success.</p>
            <h2><strong>High End</strong></h2><br />
            <p>This is where the big businesses and e-commerce websites would be looking, it contains everything within the previous section but in far greater depth. The planning behind these websites will contain an abundance of market research and marketing strategies. The content will be tailored to target specific keywords to aid in Search Engine Optimization. The design and layout will be created to present a page hierarchy and guide the attention of the user towards the calls to action and important parts of the website (usually the products). It may even contain unique and complex functionality.</p>
            <p>Hopefully this has shed some light on how to approach the development of your own website. Of course the best approach is to collaborate with your developer to find the best strategy for your specific needs - there truly is no one size fits all solution.</p>
