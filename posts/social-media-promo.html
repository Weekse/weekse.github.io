            <h1>5 Tips For Promoting Your Business Using Social Media</h1>
            <h2><strong>1. The Ideal Platform</strong></h2><br />
            <p>There is a plethora of social media websites at your disposal. Think of this as your toolbox - you need to choose the right tool for the job at hand. This depends on where your target audience is congregating, writers tend to flock to Twitter, designers tend to flock to Instagram and Pinterest, general everyday people are usually Facebook dwellers, YouTube also has a wide audience to reach out to but that requires a unique approach. Of course you can choose all of these, but along the way you need to find which one is where your audience lies and put more energy into that - this is where the majority of your new leads reside.</p>
            <h2><strong>2. Keep Organized</strong></h2><br />
            <p>You need to keep your content at the best quality, clambering to put together a last minute post isn’t going to be as good as a well thought out post with multiple revisions. Keep writing your content even if you only intend to release it once a week, this gives you the chance to revise it with a fresh perspective to make any edits before you decide to publish. It also ensures that if you become busy and can’t keep creating content you have some in the “bank”. Consistently releasing content is important to keep your audience aware of your presence.</p>
            <h2><strong>3. Don’t Over-Do It</strong></h2><br />
            <p>Having lots of high quality content is a great goal to achieve, but if you’re releasing it too frequently people will stop paying attention to every one of your posts and you’ll become “background noise”. The trick is to find the sweet spot for release, you want your posts to sink in and the “less is more” rule applies to this - frequent posts won’t carry the same weight, and rarely posting won’t ensure you’re a regular online presence. Find your rhythm and try to stick with it.</p>
            <h2><strong>4. Quality Over Quantity</strong></h2><br />
            <p>Your goal should be to gather an audience of people <em>interested</em> in what you’re offering. Having 1000 followers but none of them interested in your posts is the same as having 0 followers. You’re better having 100 followers in an audience that is genuinely interested in what you’re offering. While you’re gathering your audience focus on drawing in those within your <em>target audience</em> rather than drawing in anybody and everybody.</p>
            <h2><strong>5. Provide Value</strong></h2><br />
            <p>If you want people to pay attention and follow you, you need to give them something of value. If your audience is going to learn something useful or get valuable information they will keep paying attention to what you’re giving. Ensure all your posts have some value to your audience, this can be with tips and tricks, how-to articles, specials and discounts. When creating your content, if you approach it from the perspective of your audience and what they’d like to see you’ll have a clear vision of value to deliver.</p>
            <p>Gathering an audience is only half the battle when it comes to Social Media Promotion, keeping that audience engaged and interested is the what separates the success from the failure. As long you’re providing consistent value to the right audience they’ll keep paying attention.</p>
