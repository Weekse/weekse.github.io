            <h1>9 Tips To Improve Your Website</h1>
            <p>Most users won’t read every word on your website, and if your website is a business or a blog you’re really counting on users to stick around and come back again. In this post I’ll outline some ways you can keep your users on your website and leave them with a good user experience so that they’ll gladly come back for more!</p>
            <h2><strong>1. Fresh Content</strong></h2><br />
            <p>It goes without saying that if you want users to keep visiting your website you should keep adding new content. Having a blog or newsletter to continuously add new content will draw in new users and previous users, it’s important for this to be original, engaging and helpful. Other good methods for having continuous fresh content is podcasts, videos (how to - videos are very popular), images and discount coupons.</p>
            <h2><strong>2. Clean Layout</strong></h2><br />
            <p>The quickest way to scare away users is to have a clustered or confusing page layout. Be sure to create a flowing page hierarchy to draw your users down the page, take advantage of negative space to keep everything clean and tidy. Be sure your font size is large enough - no one wants to have to zoom in to read a paragraph and they might leave instead!</p>
            <h2><strong>3. Don’t Use Pop-Ups</strong></h2><br />
            <p>Pop-ups are annoying and disrupt the flow, if a user is reading mid sentence and a pop-up jumps in their face asking them to subscribe it leaves a negative user experience. A better solution for getting a user to subscribe would be having a fixed button that’s discrete and out of the way while still being bright and obvious floating to the side.</p>
            <h2><strong>4. Correct Link Actions</strong></h2><br />
            <p>If your content links to external websites, be sure that it opens the link in a <em>new tab</em>. This keeps the user on your website while they can navigate to the other areas on the web you want to send them. If your links overwrite your website the user may forget or not bother to return - not good!</p>
            <h2><strong>5. Responsive Website</strong></h2><br />
            <p>It is imperative that your website can reconfigure itself to fit <em>any screen size</em>. With mobile and tablets users dominating the web now, they must have a great user experience. This means your website should <em>not</em> have a horizontal scroll and the user should <em>not</em> need to zoom in to see more clearly - it should already be done for them! This will also benefit your ranking in search engines like Google.</p>
            <h2><strong>6. Avoid Sliders/Carousels</strong></h2><br />
            <p>Image slides on the home page were very trendy a few years ago, and website owners are still clinging to this concept. Having hidden content is not a good user experience, in fact most users stop viewing sliders after the first image. If you want to share a group of relevant images make sure you avoid hiding those images, find a creative way to incorporate them into the page layout so that they are all visible.</p>
            <h2><strong>7. Be Obvious</strong></h2><br />
            <p>“Don’t Make Me Think” is a good approach to creating your designs and content. You will have far more success if your users know exactly what you’re offering at a glance, most users don’t want to figure out what you’re trying to do - just hand it to them on a silver platter. Take this website for example, the first thing you see when entering the home page is a brief line of text that tells you <strong>exactly</strong> what we’re doing.</p>
            <h2><strong>8. Utilize Colours</strong></h2><br />
            <p>When you want a user to engage with parts of your website, use <strong>obvious</strong> colours to show they’re meant to click on something. Using this website as an example once again - you will notice that when we want you to click or engage with the website it will be obvious. A vibrant green button with text that tells you the action of the button such as “Tell Me More” sticks out like a sore thumb and no thought needs to go behind what that action is going to do. Also notice that the text of the button engages the user on a personal level - “Tell <strong>ME</strong> More”.</p>
            <h2><strong>9. Simple Navigation</strong></h2><br />
            <p>Once again we go back to the “Don’t Make Me Think”. Think of your navigation as both the map and the guide of your website. Make sure it is straight forward and obvious, blatantly expressing what the sections of your website are with easy to see links to those sections. If you have a large website with too many sections make sure they are nested into obvious sub-sections - for example if it were a travel website you might have a parent section for booking holidays and child sections for each country. It would look something like this: Book Holiday > Select Continent > Select Country > Select Package.</p>
            <p>These are just some of many important concepts to keep in mind when designing or writing content for any website. Implementing these will improve the experience of your users as well as making your website more successful.</p>
