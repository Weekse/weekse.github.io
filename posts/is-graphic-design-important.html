            <h1>Is Graphic Design Important For Business</h1>
            <p><strong>Graphic design</strong> has a powerful role in the marketing of a business. When it comes down to brochures, flyers, business cards, websites and logos, having a good graphic designer will create many new leads for your business.</p>
            <p>A great deal of thought goes into the concepts behind these to create a successful visual message that conveys your unique business ideas. Using the knowledge of page hierarchy, colour theory, typography, golden ratios and various other presentation techniques, a product is created to communicate a message through visual information designed to engage and persuade the target audience.</p>
            <p>An identifiable and memorable logo is imperative to build a brand identity, a successful brand identity is one thing in common that every successful business shares. A business with a brand that is easily remembered is a business that passively generates new customers, clients and leads. This of course boosts sales and ensures growth in the market. It also fills the viewers with confidence by making the business look professional while having an aesthetic style that the target audience can relate to. Using particular colours and typography can evoke certain emotions in people and engage them, when used in congruence with your business message you create trust in your brand.</p>
            <p>When it comes to presenting your products, a good graphic designer has the ability to create a connection with the audience. By maximizing the readability of the content and using a page hierarchy to guide the audiences focus to the main points, the viewer will stay engaged. If the viewer has to think to make sense of something, they will usually stop paying attention. This is particularly important for websites and brochures, once something doesnâ€™t work as the viewer or user expects they feel perturbed and will stop engaging.</p>
            <p>The first interaction a potential customer has with the brand sets the tone for the entire relationship, so the first impression of a business is very important and having a beautiful brand identity gives a lasting impression. Whether this is a flyer or brochure, a business card or a website this initial interaction can make or break a long term relationship.</p>
            <p>Consistency is key when it comes to creating a brand identity, having the right colours, shapes, typography and overall theme from the start and permeate that throughout your entire identity will make it easy to remember and that is exactly what is needed to create a successful and lasting brand identity.</p>
