However once you look under the hood, you can see all the flaws of doing this. Because these builders need to adapt to everyone’s needs while staying very simple, the final result is bloated with code. Why would a bloated website matter if most visitors aren’t viewing the source code anyway? Search engines like Google view websites through the source code and they rank websites accordingly with those coded clean, efficient and current industry standards being placed at the top.</p><p><strong>Speed and optimization -</strong> is another major factor in the ranking algorithm. Your websites performance suffers if it needs to load a bunch of useless code every single click and any images you have on your website need to be the ideal dimensions and file types to minimize these loading times. Optimized media files and minified code can improve a websites loading times exponentially. On top of that if you have a larger or more complex website, you can see great benefits in what is called “lazy loading” - which is basically loading only the elements in view rather than the entire page. This works well on media heavy websites, rather than load an entire page of images it will load the ones in first view then load the rest as they come into view as the visitor scrolls.</p><p><strong>Generic -</strong> It’s all too easy to see at a glance if a website was built off a template builder. The character of the entire website will feel the same as many others. Sure the fonts, colours, images will be different but visitors using this website will experience an unoriginal feel. Having a customized and well designed website feels fresh and fun, giving a good user experience which is paramount to success.</p><p><strong>Search Engine Optimization (SEO) -</strong> techy talk for why a website ranks highly on a Google search, it’s no surprise that templates are poor in this area. To rank highly you need to have well structured code, fast loading times, responsive/mobile friendly design and <em>targeted keywords</em>! Having a strategy behind the keywords you use, how dense they are in the content, how rich the content itself is and which words are emphasized can make all the difference to where the website appears on the search engine results. It isn’t a secret that if a website is on the first page of Google results it gets far more traffic!</p><p><strong>Time is of the essence -</strong> Not everyone has the time to make a website and have it work exactly as needed. Especially if you are a business owner, you want most of your time focused on the business itself. Now if you want a successful business you need a successful website to go with it but don’t have the time to figure out how to create a successful website, hiring a developer is the easiest option.</p><p>At the end of the day, template builders are just another tool for another job. If you ask a programmer what the best programming language is, they’ll ask you what the job is - the best language is the one most suited for the task at hand or “the right tool for the job”. If your website doesn’t need to express your unique brand or show that you’re better than your competition, but you just need some information on the web then a drag-and-drop could be the right choice. If you’re unsure you can always try a builder first and hire a developer later if things don’t go as well as you’d like (this is a very common occurrence).</p><p class="author">Written by Mathew Weekes - 12/03/19</p></div></div><div id="footer"> <div id="footer-info"> <p>&copy; Zenith Web Designs <script>document.write(new Date().getFullYear())</script></p><p>ABN: 69961896541</p><p>Albion Park, ILLAWARRA, 2527</p></div><h4>We look forward to hearing from you!</h4> <div id="contact-links"> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zenithwebdesigns/" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-facebook-f"></i></a> <a id="mail" href="mailto:zenithwebdesigns@gmail.com"><i class="far fa-envelope"></i></a> <a href="../index.html" class="footer-nav">HOME</a> <a href="../services.html" class="footer-nav">SERVICES</a> <a href="../contact.html" class="footer-nav">CONTACT</a> <a href="../blog.html" class="footer-nav">BLOG</a> </div></div><script src="../script.js"></script></body>
