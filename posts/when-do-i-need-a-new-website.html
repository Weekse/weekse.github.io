            <h1>When Do I Need A New Website?</h1>
            <p>It’s easy to put off a major update or facelift for your website or your business image, but it is imperative that these aspects of your business stay fresh and trendy to ensure maximum success. Below are some indicators that you need to update your websites design, functionality or your business image/brand identity.</p>
            <p><strong>Slow loading times</strong> has a significant impact on the success of your website. If your website takes more than two seconds to display content, many users will just not bother or their first impression is quite low. Improving website speed can be as simple as optimizing the images displayed, cleaning up the code, or implement some “lazy loading” functionality. This can sometimes be achieved over a few small updates or it could require an overhaul, depending on your websites original design and how maintained it has been kept. There are many website speed tests available online that will analyze all aspects of your website and highlight where to improve, using these can help you decide whether you need a developer to fix these issues or if you can tackle the problems yourself.</p>
            <p><strong>Broken functionality</strong> will frustrate your users and lower your reputability. This includes any part of your website that doesn’t work as expected to the user such as; bugged or confusing navigation menus, malfunctioning or convoluted forms, links that are broken or dead (i.e. links that don’t lead to the intended website or don’t lead anywhere) or poor mobile user experience. If your website is no longer easy and simple to use on all devices then you are limiting its exposure and crippling its performance. Good maintenance can prevent and fix most of these issues as they appear but a neglected or old website may require more work to smooth out all the bugs.</p>
            <p><strong>Lacking fresh content</strong> will hurt your performance in search engines. If you haven’t updated or added any new content any time recently you should consider an update to the content. This would be a good time to read over the current content on your website to ensure it is still accurate and all inclusive, you may find that a significant part of your content needs some freshening up. This may not require a whole website overhaul alone, however if redesigning or creating an entirely new website you should treat the content the same. Your content is the heart and soul of a website and should be treated and planned out as such.</p>
            <p><strong>Brand identity and design not matching</strong> could be a result of poor graphic and website design, or your brand identity may have evolved and your old design is no longer the most applicable. Having a brand identity compatible with your business goals has a subtle but important effect, an incongruence between these can cripple your success without realization. If you notice that these two don’t really make sense together, it’s time to consider a facelift on your image.</p>
            <p><strong>No new customers</strong> is a good sign to change your approach on generating leads. Your website plays a major role in this area, whether it is directly generating your leads or propping up your reputability and trust, your website performing at its peak is very important in converting potential customers into recurring customers. Sometimes this can be overcome with only a change in your marketing strategy, but if your website hasn’t been updated in some time this could be the cause.</p>
            <p><strong>Constant bugs and troubleshooting</strong> is a sign that your website needs some serious work. Just as if your car was giving you consistent troubles you’d start to look for a replacement, your website is the same. A few issues here and there are to be expected if you have a large or complex website but if these are cropping up left, right and centre it is usually easier just to start over. This is common and problematic on Wordpress websites that have a bunch of plugins thrown into the mix, usually by non-developers, that aren’t compatible or are just poorly developed.</p>
            <p>These are the usual signals that your website could use a fresh start. All of these issues will effect your search engine performance, thus crippling how effective your website actually is.</p>
